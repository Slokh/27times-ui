      "For months I have missed what will formally be known as our future. I am fully aware that we are deeply and carelessly planning the “future” together, but it’s not what I thought it would be.\n\nI am holding on to two realities, living two lives, and imagining two futures. One where I love you, which is true. And another where I don’t want to be married to you, which is also true.\n\nMy love for you is mixed up with grief. So much grief.\n\nGrieving our twenties, grieving my father + your future father in law + grandfather of our children, the nights on the couch, the times you’ve left, the times I’ve locked you out, ignored you, shut you down, the words you’ve screamed, the tears and time i lost. the hugs and kisses i didn’t get when i needed them, but didn’t want anyways.\n\nI’m grieving our future and the happiness I felt when I thought of us. Songs that used to remind me of you make me miss you even when you’re right next to me.\n\nI know I am to blame. I wish I was open and available. I wish I could show my heart the way I see yours. I wish I could accept the reality of so many unhappily married couples— maybe we don’t need to be lovers or even friends to be married, but we used to be both and I want and need both and more.\n\nI wanted it all so badly I didn’t even wait for us to work through this part of our relationship. Every day that goes by feels like a ticking time bomb. Like I’m failing us, our family, our future. We made this decision and it became about so much more than just us. If I believed what we have right now is enough, while knowing it will never be what i really want it to be, or imagined it to be since i was little, we might be able to get through this.\n\nEvery moment we’ve been through, be it insanely happy or immensely sad, casts a small line from my heart. At first it was a few. But now there are so many tangled, knitted, bunched and bound. It’s a mess I might never be able to undo. The pain is like putting bandaids over bullet wounds. We keep covering them and kissing them better until we stop kissing and stop covering altogether. The wounds are infected and bones are fractured. Everything hurts. Everything.\n\nEvery day I hope the clouds part and the storm will end but neither of us are the sun.\n\nI am afraid to lose you. I’ve felt afraid to lose you before but nothing the way I felt in the last year. Every time you’ve left the house there’s a deep void and crippling fear that you won’t come back.\n\nPart of it is the grief but most of it is trust. You’ve done it before- intentionally. You’ve let me scream and beg and hang off your body desperate for you to stay and still you’ve walked out just to drive to the other side of the street or the house and know you’ve taken a piece of my heart with me.\n\nYou’ve known my loss and my fear and my pain and you’ve swallowed it. At the very least, whenever you can, you’ve chewed it up and spit it out. On December 31 you left. Not drunk or explosive but you left. Left me crying on the couch with no explanation after I told you I was unhappy. To me, at that moment, it became clear that we were never getting better.\n\nI wish I could love more, forgive more, forget more, move on more. I wish I could reach out and touch more. It’s not that I never do, but when I do it’s in the safety and stillness of 3am when you’re sound asleep. It’s a finger on your back or a brush of my hand across your chest. It’s all that I can manage and it’s the only time I can function without the scrutiny of my own judgement.",

The world is so big in California. Could I ever be more than a few inches tall here?  I've learned to grow only in my cage as I know it. When the door opens, I look at it and feel like I can fly. But then the world I see looks back at me and I forget... I just forget who ever it was I wanted to be.\nDiscernment:  It’s an impossible practice if I can't even be free from judgement against myself.\nWho the fuck cares about me, if not me? Why are you sad? Do you even know? Why are you yelling at yourself at this very moment?\nBe sweet. Be gentle. With yourself. Like you are with him.\nCould you die never knowing what you were capable of? Or could you live to become the person you were destined to be, even if it kills you? How does the sun feel? How does love feel? Still so many questions need answering.\nWhy would anyone put salt in their latte? To be that, you have to learn that. Since when are you the teacher?\nWrite down what you're afraid of:\nbeing forgotten\nbeing fake\nbeing forgotten\nbeing real\nbirds\nmasks\ndiscernment\nhim\nAnything else?

No, not your first kiss. Our first kiss. Your first kiss with everyone before me, and your first kiss with someone after me. I guess lots of deaths have happened by cause of your lips. maybe more from mine. The first kiss is fun, it’s intimidating and usually rushed. It’s like, are we really going to do this? have you been thinking about it as long as I have? What if we did this sooner? Fuck. Why didn’t we do this sooner?\n\nWhen you finally get the answer to those questions, time stops and the earth is suspended on its axle. You feel like you're the only two people in the world. To be honest, it’s usually not even that great. The tightness in your chest and the heat from the back of your neck as their tongue slides between your lips. feeling it’s way around a new environment. small moans and delicate strokes. a first kiss is the most anticipated death wish. every beginning has an end.",
